Create an application that shows the five closest Jumbo stores to a given position.

You can find a list of Jumbo stores in JSON format attached to this e-mail.There are just a few rules:

·         It has to be NodeJS.
            What you use besides NodeJS is up to you.
            A note: in most of our NodeJS teams we use NodeJS together with GraphQL, VueJS and MongoDB.

·         It has to be a web application. We would like to see at least an API, having an HTML/Javascript frontend is a nice to have.

·         Write your code as if it’s production code as much as possible.

·         Make sure the reviewer can easily run the application for evaluation purposes. Extra points for a cloud version.

·         Feel free to add some additional features you think are cool!
